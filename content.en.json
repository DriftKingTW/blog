{"pages":[],"posts":[{"title":"A Better Server Status Monitoring Tool - Glances (htop/top Alternative)","text":"Recently, I’m looking for a temperture and cpu status monitor for my Pi nas server. vcgencmd command and htop get the jobs done, but it’s always better to have them in the same window (htop can’t show temperture which bothers me alot). So I found an cross-platform, python-based htop alternative - Glances, it’s easy to install and super handy. The only downside is that it uses a bit more cpu resources than I expected (on Pi4 4GB version). InstallationIn Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) you can simply use apt-get to install. sudo apt-get install glances If you have Homebrew installed on MacOS, use brew to install. brew install glances Note that I have run into some trouble when installing on MacOS, it shows the error message like this: 1234Traceback (most recent call last): File \"/usr/local/Cellar/glances/3.1.3/libexec/bin/glances\", line 6, in &lt;module&gt; from pkg_resources import load_entry_pointModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources' After googling, post-install should solved the problem. brew postinstall python3 Windows need to install python first, and use pip to get glances pip install glances UsageHost modeOpen Terminal and run glances glances Show RAW JSON status glances --stdout cpu.user,mem.used,load or in CSV format glances --stdout-csv now,cpu.user,mem.used,load Enter q or Esc to quit Server/Client ModeServer side: glances -s Client side (change SERVER-IP to your own server ip): glances -s SERVER-IP Remote mode (Web-UI)Server side: glances -w Client side (change SERVER-IP to your own server ip, default port 61208): http://SERVER-IP:61208 Done! Now you can monitoring all status (including cpu-temperture) in comfort!
